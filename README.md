# 2 dimensional brownian motion
This repository contains a simulation implemented in c++ using finite elements method, for the brownian motion exhibit by a particle confined in a two dimensional gas. 
The analysis of simulated data is performed in python using pandas and pystan. An additional stochastic simulation is performed in python to replicate the behavior of the system based in the analytical treatment of browian motion.
